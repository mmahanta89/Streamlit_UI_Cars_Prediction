# Using Streamlit UI

## AIML Capstone Projecct


The capstone project is a focused approach to attempt a real-life challenge with the learnings from the program. The Goals of the Projects achieved are: • Computer Vision: Locate the position of inflammation in an image and Design a DL based car identification model • Natural Language Processing: Build a classifier that can classify the tickets by analyzing text and Design a ML/DL based chatbot utility which can help the professionals to highlight the safety risk as per the incident description

### Skills and Tools

CNN, Text Preprocessing, LSTM, Chat bot, Car Identification Model

Object detection Model used - FRCNN

Object Classsification - Resnet50

UI - Streamlit

- For weights we used Resnet50 weights
- Place the pretrained weights for Object detection under model folder
- Place the pretrained weights for object classification under main folder
